description: "Scaffold or update per-repo configuration for engineering skills: issue tracker convention, project state and compile commands, triage label vocabulary, domain doc layout, engineering principles (with a per-change verification quick reference), and multi-repo coordination. Use when the user asks to initialize or reconfigure project collaboration, or when an existing project has no usable instructions and the current task requires project-wide setup. Also use to refresh repo principles and project handoff in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md; re-run when project structure changes. Do not require it for every small task or before a normal code review."

# Setup Project

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Working principles** — a fixed first-principles reasoning prompt written verbatim into the `## Agent skills` rules block, so every agent session in the repo reasons from evidence
- **Engineering principles** — a stack-tailored `## Engineering principles` section in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md (design-first planning, module quality, boundaries, security, concurrency, UX, reuse, maintainability, reversibility) plus a change quick-reference mapping each kind of change to its verification commands
- **Project structure** — single repo, monorepo (multiple packages in one repo), or multi-repo (multiple related repos)
- **Issue tracker** — where issues live (GitHub, GitLab, Gitee via official MCP/OpenAPI, local markdown, or other)
- **Triage labels** — the strings used for the five canonical triage roles
- **Domain docs** — where `CONTEXT.md`, ADRs, PRDs, and the research index live; how consumer skills find them across repos
- **Documentation language** — the language skills should write human-facing output in (PRDs, ADRs, CONTEXT, Issues, comments), so output is readable for the team regardless of who triggers the skill
- **Coding standards** — optional project conventions and technical profile (such as `ruoyi-plus-dev`), loaded by consumer skills
- **Project handoff** — concise current state, durable decisions, versioned verification evidence, and affected-side compile commands
- **Agent collaboration** — when multiple agents share a project, define role ownership and handoff in `docs/agents/ai-collaboration.md`

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

**Can be re-run.** If `docs/agents/` already exists, read current config first, detect what changed since last setup, present only the sections that need updating, and rewrite affected files. The user can also use this to switch issue trackers, add/remove repos from the map, or reorganize domain docs.

## Relationship to the Entry Protocol

This skill creates the configuration that the [Skill Entry Protocol](../rules/entry-protocol.md) reads at the start of every consumer skill. Without this setup, consumer skills fall back to default paths and guesses.

| Config file | Entry Protocol Step | What it tells the consumer skill |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/agents/domain.md` | Step 1 | Actual paths for CONTEXT.md, PRDs, ADRs, and `docs/research/INDEX.md` |
| `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` | Step 1 | Issue tracker type and CLI conventions |
| `docs/agents/ai-collaboration.md` | Step 1 | Multi-agent role ownership, handoff, and write boundaries |
| `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` | Step 1 | Label vocabulary mapping for the five canonical triage roles |
| `docs/agents/language.md` | Step 1 | Language for all human-facing prose (PRDs, ADRs, CONTEXT, Issues, comments) |
| `docs/agents/coding-standards.md` | Step 1a (if configured) | Scoped conventions, technical profile, source evidence, and verification commands |
| `docs/agents/repo-map.md` | Step 2 (if exists) | Multi-repo structure — which repos exist, which owns the primary issue tracker |
| `docs/agents/project-state.md` | Step 1 | Current objective, blockers, next step, and actual backend/frontend compile commands |
| `docs/agents/project-decisions.md` | Step 1 | Durable confirmed choices and their scope |
| `docs/agents/verification.md` | Step 1 | Versioned verification evidence and known gaps |

This is not a consumer skill — it is the **foundation** that consumer skills depend on. The Entry Protocol's "If missing" degradation paths ensure skills still work without setup-project, but with reduced precision.

## Outcome Contract

- **Outcome**: `docs/agents/` directory with issue-tracker, triage-labels, domain docs, documentation language, project-state, project-decisions, verification, optional multi-agent collaboration contract, optional coding-standards registration, and (for multi-repo) repo-map; `## Agent skills` block in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md opening with the fixed Working principles (first-principles) prompt, followed by the tailored `## Engineering principles` section with its change quick-reference. On re-run: conformance sweep results — naming, language, and format audit of existing doc files.
- **Done when**: User confirms configuration, all files written, AGENTS.md updated
- **Evidence**: `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`, `docs/agents/language.md`, `docs/agents/project-state.md`, `docs/agents/project-decisions.md`, `docs/agents/verification.md`; `coding-standards.md` when configured; `docs/agents/repo-map.md` (multi-repo only); `## Engineering principles` section present and tailored (scope matches detected stack, quick-reference commands are real repo commands)
- **Output**: Summary of configuration, next step to use engineering skills

## Process Summary

**Step 1: Explore** — detect current repo state (remote, AGENTS.md, existing docs/agents/, workspace/monorepo structure) and stack signals for the principles tailoring (frontend/backend/DB, multi-tenant, verification scripts). If `docs/agents/` exists, read all current config files to understand existing setup.

**Step 2: Detect project structure** — single repo, monorepo, or multi-repo. Ask the user if detection is uncertain or if there are related repos not visible in this clone. If config already exists, compare detected structure against `repo-map.md` to find what changed.

**Step 3: Present findings** — show detected defaults (project structure, issue tracker, triage labels, domain layout, documentation language, project handoff and compile commands). If updating, show a diff of what changed vs current config.

**Step 4: Ask for overrides** — present the full detected configuration as a draft; ask if anything needs changing. If the user wants to change something, walk through that section one at a time. Sections: A (Issue Tracker), B (Triage Labels), C (Domain Docs), D (Documentation Language), E (Engineering Principles — scope, line bound, dependency paths, quick-reference commands), F (Coding Standards — existing conventions and optional technical profile), G (Project Handoff and Compile Commands). For G, record actual backend/frontend compile commands and working directories. Default to compiling only affected sides, skipping tests; do not ask the user to select delivery profiles or approve routine compilation. Do not independently run lint, type checks, tests or browser checks unless explicitly requested; preserve compilation checks built into the existing build command. If everything looks good, proceed.

**Step 4a (Re-run only): Conformance sweep** — After config overrides are confirmed, scan `docs/prd/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/research/` for files that don't match the new settings. Group findings by naming, language, format, and metadata. For naming violations suggest rename; for language flag and suggest manual translation or an installed writing skill; for format/metadata report only. Confirm with user before acting. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) Conformance Sweep.

**Step 5: Confirm** — show the complete draft of all files to be written (AGENTS.md block + each `docs/agents/` file). If updating, show only files that changed.

**Step 6: Write** — write the `docs/agents/*.md` config files first, the AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md sections last (an abort mid-way then leaves at most an unchanged AGENTS.md, never a block pointing at missing files): the `## Agent skills` block, then the tailored `## Engineering principles` section after it (see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) Step 6). When multiple agents are used, include `ai-collaboration.md` from its template and fill in the actual agent roles, tracker, and handoff path. When writing `domain.md`, scan `docs/prd/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/research/` first and use actual filenames in the file tree, not template placeholders (see REFERENCE.md domain.md template note). Write state, decisions and verification files from actual confirmed project facts; never leave example placeholders or record unverified claims as current facts. Record actual compile commands in `project-state.md` and the default affected-side compilation rule in the project `## Agent skills` block; no delivery-profile selection is needed. Update in-place, never append duplicates.

**Step 7: Done** — list skills now configured, suggest next step

## Gotchas

| What happened | Rule |
|---|---|
| Assumed GitHub without checking remote | Step 1: Run `git remote -v` first |
| Missed monorepo/multi-repo structure | Step 2: Check for workspace files, subprojects, sibling repos |
| Monorepo: only configured root, missed packages | Step 6: Create per-package `docs/agents/` dirs in monorepo |
| Multi-repo: no coordination between repos | Step 6: Create `repo-map.md` linking repos to skill domains |
| Asked all decisions at once | Step 3-4: present detected defaults first, then ask for overrides one section at a time |
| Created AGENTS.md when CLAUDE.md (or neither) exists | Step 6: Edit the file that exists; don't silently default to AGENTS.md |
| Duplicated existing `## Agent skills` block | Step 6: Update in-place, don't append |
| Paraphrased or dropped the Working principles prompt | Step 6: Copy it verbatim — fixed text, not a per-repo template |
| Template principles copied wholesale into a single-stack repo | Step 4E: tailor to the detected stack — drop <Backend>/<Frontend>/<Multi-tenant> blocks that don't apply, confirm scope with the user |
| Quick-reference commands invented instead of read from the repo | Step 4E: fill from package.json scripts / Makefile / CI config; drop rows with no real command |
| Gitee remote treated as GitHub / GitLab | Use the Gitee template and connected MCP or OpenAPI; preserve string Issue numbers |
| Standards not re-read before each check | Entry Protocol Step 1a: reload the selected profile and scoped standards before a compliance verdict |
| Overwrote the user's hand-written principles section | Step 4E: if an `## Engineering principles` section already exists, ask adopt/merge/replace — never silently overwrite |
| Wrote files without user confirmation | Step 5: Show full draft before writing |
| Re-run: overwrote unchanged sections / missed drift | Step 1-2: Read existing config, compare structure against `repo-map.md`, only update what changed |
| Re-run: language change undetected / per-package out of sync | Step 4D / Step 6: Compare existing config against current state on re-run |
| Re-run: domain.md shows template examples, not actual files | Step 6: scan `docs/prd/` `docs/adr/` `docs/research/` for real filenames before writing domain.md |
| Re-run: renamed PRDs not updated in referencing files | After renaming, scan `docs/adr/` and `CONTEXT.md` for references to old name; suggest update |
| Re-run: language change didn't reach existing docs | Language Audit: flag files in wrong language; recommend manual translation or an installed writing skill — don't auto-translate |
| Re-run: format drift not detected | Format Audit: compare each file's section structure against its FORMAT spec |
| Migration: orphaned files after structure change (e.g. single→monorepo) | Step 2: Detect drift, present migration path, clean up with confirmation |

**Re-run (config update):**
```
Config updated.

Changes:
- <what changed, e.g., "Switched issue tracker from GitHub to GitLab">
- <what changed, e.g., "Language changed from Chinese to English">

Updated files:
- docs/agents/<file>.md — updated (changed: <sections>)
- <... other files ...>

Conformance sweep:
- ✅ Naming: all files conform
- ⚠️ Language: 1 file in wrong language (manual translation or installed writing skill)
- ✅ Format: all files comply

Done with 1 finding, 0 fixed (requires manual translation or an installed writing skill).

Next: Re-run affected skills if config change affects their behavior (e.g., after language change, update flagged docs with an installed writing skill).
