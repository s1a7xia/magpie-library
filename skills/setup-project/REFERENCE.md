## Re-run Checklist

When `docs/agents/` already exists, run this drift detection loop **before** any user interaction. Each config file is checked against the current repo state:

| Config file | Detection check | Drift signal | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `issue-tracker.md` | `git remote -v` → does the remote match the tracker type in the file? | Remote changed (GitHub→GitLab, or no remote→local) | Present change, confirm, rewrite `issue-tracker.md` |
| `ai-collaboration.md` | Are multiple agents still used, and do role ownership and handoff path match the project? | Agent roles, write boundaries, or tracker handoff changed | Present affected fields, confirm, update the contract |
| `coding-standards.md` | Read existing standards, selected profile, stack/version, source paths and verification commands | Profile/version changed, source moved, command no longer exists, or the project now follows an installed profile that was never registered | Present the affected fields; preserve hand-written standards and explicit exceptions. If a profile is now applicable, ask the Section F question and register it |
| `triage-labels.md` | Check actual labels on 1-2 recent issues → do they still match the file? | Labels renamed, added, or deprecated | Present change, confirm, rewrite `triage-labels.md` |
| `domain.md` | Does `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exist now when it didn't before? Were domain dirs (`docs/prd/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/research/`) reorganized? | Context layout changed (single↔multi), dirs moved | Present change, confirm, rewrite `domain.md` |
| `language.md` | Read existing value. Ask: "Is `<language>` still the right doc language for the team?" | Language preference changed | Confirm, rewrite `language.md`. If changed, trigger **Conformance Sweep** (Language Audit) |
| **doc content** | Scan `docs/prd/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/research/` for naming/language/format drift | Config changed (language, naming, FORMAT) | Trigger **Conformance Sweep** after overrides |
| `ai-collaboration.md` — WeChat entry | Is the entry still wanted, and do the project facts (root, remote, inbox path) still match? | Entry turned on/off, or root/remote/inbox changed | Present the change, confirm, update the sections, and re-print the registry entry for the user to replace in `~/.dsh/im/PROJECTS.md` |
| `repo-map.md` (if exists) | Has the project structure changed? (Workspace files added/removed? User mentions sibling repos?) | Package count changed, repos added/removed, project type (single↔mono↔multi) changed | Present diff, confirm, rewrite `repo-map.md`. If project type changed → trigger **Migration** path below |
| (no `repo-map.md` yet) | Detect new multi-repo or monorepo signals: workspace files, user mentions sibling repos, subproject dirs | New structure signals found | Ask if project structure changed, create `repo-map.md` if needed |
| AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md (optional) | Does a project file already exist? Does it contain copied global rules instead of a short pointer to `docs/agents/`? | File exists, or the user explicitly asked for one | Keep only project-specific facts and a short `## Project context` pointer; remove duplicated global workflow |
| `docs/agents/coding-standards.md` Project engineering principles | Re-run stack detection and script scan — do scope, file-size bound, dependency paths and quick-reference commands still match? | Stack dimension added/removed, verification scripts renamed/added, section missing | Present diff, confirm, update in place |

**If no drift detected in any section**, tell the user: "All config is current — no changes needed." and stop.

## Re-run Behavior

When re-running, follow this sequence:

1. **Read current config** — load all existing `docs/agents/*.md` files before detecting anything new
2. **Run the Re-run Checklist** (above) — detect drift per config file
3. **Present diff** — show what changed vs what stayed the same. Only ask about changed sections.
4. **Update selectively** — rewrite only files that need changes. Leave untouched files alone.

If the user says "update repo map" or "switch issue tracker", focus on that section only. Still run the full checklist first to verify nothing else drifted.

## Migration (Structural Changes)

When the repo's structure has changed significantly since the last setup-project run, additional migration actions are needed beyond the normal re-run update.

| Previous state | Current state | Migration actions |
|---|---|---|
| **Single repo** | **Monorepo** (workspace files detected) | Add per-package `docs/agents/` dirs for packages with their own domain scope. Update `domain.md` to mention multi-context option. If `CONTEXT-MAP.md` was created, reference it in `domain.md`. |
| **Single repo** | **Multi-repo** (user mentions sibling repos) | Create `repo-map.md` listing all repos. Update `issue-tracker.md` to reference the primary tracker. Ask: "Which repo owns the primary issue tracker for cross-repo features?" |
| **Monorepo** | **Single repo** (workspace removed) | Remove per-package `docs/agents/` dirs (**ask first** — destructive). Simplify `domain.md` back to single-context. If `CONTEXT-MAP.md` was removed, remove references to it. |
| **Multi-repo** | **Single repo** | Remove `repo-map.md` (**ask first** — destructive). Simplify `issue-tracker.md` to point to this repo's tracker. |
| **Monorepo** | **Multi-repo** (packages split into separate repos) | Move per-package config to the new repos (`repo-map.md` + per-repo `docs/agents/`). Ask: "Which repo gets the shared domain docs?" |
| Any structure | **Reorganized domain dirs** (e.g. `docs/prd/` renamed or split across contexts) | Update `domain.md` with new paths. Check if old paths have stale files and ask about cleanup. |

**Rule:** Migration implies rewriting more files than a normal re-run. Always present the full diff of what will be created, rewritten, and removed. Get explicit approval before removing any files (anti-pattern #16).

## Conformance Sweep (Re-run Only)

After config overrides are confirmed, sweep existing domain docs for drift against the new settings. This runs **after** Step 4 but **before** writing files.

### Naming Audit

Check each file's name against the convention defined in the relevant FORMAT spec:

| Directory | Expected pattern | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| `docs/prd/` | `PRD-NNNN-<title>.md` | `PRD-0001-user-subscription.md` |
| `docs/adr/` | `<NNNN>-<title>.md` (no `ADR-` prefix) | `0001-event-sourced-orders.md` |
| `docs/research/` | `<stack>-<topic>-<major>.md` | `react-concurrent-rendering-18.md` |

For each mismatch: report `<file> does not match convention — expected <pattern>`. Renaming is a destructive op: list every violating file individually, then request one explicit authorization covering exactly that listed set (anti-pattern #16 — this is same-shape op authorization, not interview questioning; it does not relax the one-decision-per-message rule for actual decisions).

### Language Audit

Read `docs/agents/language.md` for expected language. Scan each file's first 3 lines of prose:

- If detected language differs from setting → flag the file
- Do NOT auto-translate → suggest manual translation or an installed writing skill
- Report: `"<file> is in <detected>, but language.md requires <expected>. Translate it manually or with an installed writing skill."`

### Format Audit

Compare each file's section headers against its FORMAT spec:

| Type | Required sections |
|------|------------------|
| PRD | `# Title`, `## Goal`, `## Requirements`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, `## Out of Scope`, `## Traceability` |
| ADR | `# Title`, `## Status`, `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Consequences` |
| Research | `# Title`, `## TL;DR`, `## Question`, `## Approach`, `## Findings`, `## Verdict`, `## Boundary Conditions`, `## Sources` |

Report missing or extra sections. Do NOT auto-add placeholder sections.

### Metadata Consistency

Check PRD `## Traceability` fields against lifecycle:
- `Sliced into` exists but child issues list empty?
- `Status` says `Grilled` but `Grilled by` empty?
- Child Issue referenced but `## Issue` field missing?
- `Status` says `Done` but not all child issues `— Done`?

Informational only — report, don't auto-fix.

### Action Rules

| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Naming** | List each misnamed file; one explicit authorization for the listed renames only (destructive-op rule #16). |
| **Language** | Flag only; suggest manual translation or an installed writing skill. Never auto-translate. |
| **Format** | Report deviations only. Never auto-add empty sections. |
| **Metadata** | Report inconsistencies only. Never auto-fix. |

## Traceability

This skill does not create or modify PRDs, so it does not fill any PRD `## Traceability` field. Instead, its outputs form the **config layer** of the project's traceability chain:

```
setup-project (config layer)
    ↓ docs/agents/*.md are read by the Entry Protocol
    ↓
think / research / grill / story / implement / review / debug
    ↓ each fills its own PRD Traceability fields
```

Consumer skills reference these config files via the [Skill Entry Protocol](../rules/entry-protocol.md), which reads `docs/agents/` at startup. Without this setup, consumer skills degrade to guesses and defaults (entry protocol "If missing" paths).

When the project structure changes, re-running `/setup-project` updates the config layer so all downstream skills continue to read correct paths.

## Step 1: Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `git remote -v` — GitHub, GitLab, Gitee, another host, or no remote? Handle HTTPS and SSH forms. With multiple remotes, retain an explicit tracker selection; a mirror alone does not select the tracker. A ZIP without `.git` is not evidence that the project uses local issues.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — does either exist? Is there already a project-level rules section? If neither exists, do not create one by default; project facts belong in `docs/agents/`.
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and `docs/prd/` directories
- `docs/agents/` — does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `.scratch/` — sign that a local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use
- Existing coding standards, CONTRIBUTING/style guides, linter configs, user-supplied conventions, and source evidence for any selected technical profile

**Monorepo detection (Step 2):**
- `package.json` with `"workspaces"` field (npm/yarn)
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — pnpm workspaces
- `lerna.json` — Lerna monorepo
- `Cargo.toml` with `[workspace]` — Rust monorepo
- `go.work` or `go.mod` with workspace — Go workspace
- `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.poe.tasks]` or similar — Python workspace
- `build.gradle.kts` or `settings.gradle.kts` — Gradle multi-project
- `pom.xml` with `<modules>` — Maven multi-module
- `subprojects/` or `packages/` or `apps/` or `libs/` directory patterns
- `docs/adr/` inside subdirectories — sign of per-package architecture tracking

**Stack detection (feeds the engineering-principles tailoring, Section E):**

- Frontend: framework deps in `package.json` (react/vue/svelte/next/…), `src/components|app|pages` directories
- Backend: server entrypoints, `api/`/`server/` directories, backend framework deps
- Database: ORM config (drizzle/prisma/knex/typeorm/…), `migrations/` directories, schema files
- Multi-tenant signals: auth middleware, tenant/org IDs in schemas, "multi-tenant" in the README
- Verification commands: package.json `scripts`, Makefile, justfile, CI workflows — candidates for the change quick reference

## Step 2: Detect Project Structure

Based on your exploration, classify the project:

| Signal | Classification |
|---|---|
| No workspace files, no subproject dirs | **Single repo** |
| Workspace files found (see Step 1), multiple packages/apps/libs | **Monorepo** |
| User mentions related repos or sibling repos exist outside this clone | **Multi-repo** |
| Both workspace files AND related repos | **Monorepo + Multi-repo** |

Ask the user to confirm the detection. If unsure, ask: "Is this a single project, a monorepo with multiple packages, or part of a multi-repo setup?"

### Multi-repo: Collect Repo Information

If multi-repo, collect the repos one at a time — one repo per message, each field derived from prior answers where possible (git remotes often already name the repos and URLs; read those first, don't ask). Per repo:
- **Repo name/slug** — e.g., `backend`, `frontend`, `shared`
- **Remote URL** — so skills can reference it
- **Domain role** — what the repo does (API server, web app, shared library, infrastructure)
- **Issue tracker** — which repo's issues should skills use for story creation? (usually the "main" or "frontend" repo)

Record this as `docs/agents/repo-map.md` (see seed template below).

## Step 3: Present Findings

Summarise what's present and what's missing. Show the detected defaults:

- **Project structure**: single repo / monorepo / multi-repo
- **Issue tracker**: GitHub (`github.com`), GitLab (confirmed public/self-hosted), Gitee (`gitee.com`, official MCP/OpenAPI), or Local markdown (confirmed local tracking). Unknown/private hosts require identifying the actual service/API; do not infer GitLab or public Gitee solely from a hostname.
- **Triage labels**: defaults (needs-triage, needs-info, ready-for-agent, ready-for-human, wontfix)
- **Domain docs**: single-context (one CONTEXT.md + docs/adr/ at root) or multi-context (CONTEXT-MAP.md exists)
- **Documentation language**: undetected by default — present as "please choose" (see Section D). If existing PRDs/ADRs/CONTEXT.md are consistently in one language, offer that as the recommended default.
- **Project engineering principles**: detected stack scope (fullstack / backend-only / frontend-only; multi-tenant yes/no) and candidate quick-reference commands, from the Step 1 stack detection (see Section E). These are written to `docs/agents/coding-standards.md`.
- **Technical profile**: default to `ruoyi-6-vue` (RuoYi-Vue-Plus) with no framework-signature probe and no "is this RuoYi?" question (see Section F). Exclude it only when the user identifies the project as non-RuoYi; use another installed profile only when the user names it. Read the checkout only to fill the exact version, governed paths and real commands

## Step 4: Ask for Overrides

Present the detected configuration. Ask the user: "Does this look right? Anything to change?"

If the user wants to change something, walk through that section **one at a time**:

### Section A — Issue Tracker

> The "issue tracker" is where issues live for this repo. Skills like `story` and `review` read from and write to it — they need to know whether to call `gh issue create`, write a markdown file under `.scratch/`, or follow some other workflow you describe.

Options:
- **GitHub** — issues live in the repo's GitHub Issues (uses the `gh` CLI)
- **GitLab** — issues live in the repo's GitLab Issues (uses the `glab` CLI)
- **Gitee** — issues/PRs live on Gitee; use an already-connected official MCP or the OpenAPI v5 operation map in [templates/issue-tracker-gitee.md](templates/issue-tracker-gitee.md). Record owner/repo, chosen remote, API base and credential environment-variable name. For Enterprise/private services verify the actual API/MCP. Check access with a read before remote writes, without creating test issues or displaying tokens.
- **Local markdown** — issues live as files under `.scratch/<feature>/` in this repo (good for solo projects or repos without a remote)
- **Other** (Jira, Linear, etc.) — ask the user to describe the workflow in one paragraph; the skill will record it as freeform prose

For **multi-repo**: ask which repo owns the primary issue tracker. The other repos' `issue-tracker.md` can point to the primary repo's tracker.

### Section B — Triage Label Vocabulary

> When issues are created or managed, they carry triage labels. The five canonical roles:

- `needs-triage` — maintainer needs to evaluate
- `needs-info` — waiting on reporter
- `ready-for-agent` — fully specified, AFK-ready (an agent can pick it up with no human context)
- `ready-for-human` — needs human implementation
- `wontfix` — will not be actioned

Ask the user if they want to override any of the default label strings. If their issue tracker has no existing labels, the defaults are fine.

### Section C — Domain Docs

> Some skills (`debug`, `review`, `implement`, `story`) read `CONTEXT.md` for domain language, `docs/adr/` for past decisions, and `docs/prd/` for product requirements. They need to know where these live.

Options:
- **Single-context** — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` + `docs/prd/` at the repo root. Most repos are this.
- **Multi-context** — `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files (typically a monorepo). PRDs and ADRs may be per-context or shared.

For **multi-repo**: the domain docs may be split across repos. The `repo-map.md` records which repo owns which docs. Consumer skills check the map first.

### Section D — Documentation Language

> Skills produce a lot of human-facing text: PRDs, ADRs, `CONTEXT.md`, issue bodies and titles, review reports, comments. Writing all of it in one consistent language keeps the docs readable for the whole team — regardless of which member (or agent session) triggered the skill. Without this config, each skill falls back to "follow the user's input language", which drifts whenever a different member runs a skill.

Options:
- **English** — all human-facing output is written in English.
- **Chinese (中文)** — all human-facing output is written in Chinese.
- **Other** — name the language (e.g. 日本語, Deutsch); skills write output in it.

This is a **single language for the whole project** — it applies uniformly to PRDs, ADRs, `CONTEXT.md`, Issues, and comments. It is recorded in `docs/agents/language.md`, and every consumer skill reads it via the Skill Entry Protocol. Code, identifiers, and CLI commands are never affected — only prose.

**Detection heuristic (Step 3):** there is nothing in the repo that reliably reveals the team's preferred doc language, so do **not** guess. Surface this section as "undetected — please choose" and let the user pick. If `CONTEXT.md` or existing PRDs already exist and are consistently in one language, offer that as the recommended default.

**Common pitfall:** the user typing the command is not necessarily the audience. A Chinese-speaking developer may still want English docs for an international team. Ask which language the *team* reads, not which language the conversation is in.

### Section E — Project Engineering Principles

> Project-specific engineering rules — design-first boundaries, module quality, security, concurrency, UX, dependency checks, and per-change verification — belong in `docs/agents/coding-standards.md`, not in a project `AGENTS.md`. The global Magpie instructions already carry the shared working principles and workflow.

Present the detected tailoring as a draft; the user confirms or edits:

- **Scope** — which conditional blocks apply (<Multi-tenant>, <Backend>, <Frontend>), from Step 1 stack detection
- **File-size bound** — principle 2's line limit (suggest 500 when the repo shows no other convention)
- **Dependency-check locations** — principle 7's where-to-check-first paths (from workspace detection)
- **Change quick reference** — baseline and per-change-type commands, filled from package.json scripts / Makefile / CI config. Never invent commands; a row with no real command is dropped, not guessed.
- **Language** — the section is rendered in the Section D language (headings and prose translated; commands, paths, and identifiers stay as-is)

Write the result into `## Project engineering principles` and `## Verification quick reference` in `docs/agents/coding-standards.md`, using [templates/engineering-principles.md](templates/engineering-principles.md) as source material. If the project already carries a hand-written engineering-principles section in `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, ask adopt/merge/replace; do not duplicate it into the new file.

### Section F — Coding Standards and Technical Profile

Read existing project/team conventions first. When supplied, register their maintained paths and scope in `docs/agents/coding-standards.md`, seeded from [templates/coding-standards.md](templates/coding-standards.md); preserve explicit exceptions. A project `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` pointer is optional and only used when the file already exists or the user explicitly asks for one. Before declaring setup complete, actually read the registered profile and its original rules; report a missing dependency without declaring that profile ready. Do not copy the full standard into each workflow skill.

**Default to the RuoYi-Vue-Plus technical profile without probing signatures.** `ruoyi-6-vue` (RuoYi-Vue-Plus 6.1.0 + Vue) applies by default. Put it in the confirmation draft together with everything else; the draft is the user's chance to select a project override. Never ask a separate "is this RuoYi?" question. If the user confirms non-RuoYi, record `Technical profile: none` or the user-named alternative plus the reason in the project config. That explicit project setting overrides the global default in later sessions.

For the default or a user-named profile, read the checkout only to establish registration facts — the exact version, governed module paths and real verification commands. Do not use those facts to re-decide whether the default applies. For RuoYi-Vue-Plus, take the exact version from the parent POM, never from a guess.

**Once a profile is established** (the default, a user-named alternative, or none), register it and surface its framework-specific constraints in the project config, not only inside the profile skill:

- Record the profile by name, its version/stack, and the scope it governs (modules, file types, languages).
- Carry the profile's hard constraints into the registration — either the **Additional standards** field or an explicit **Project decisions and exceptions** entry. For a RuoYi-Vue-Plus profile these include "do not introduce original-RuoYi APIs", "check `sys_config`/`sys_dict_*` and existing entities before adding a table", and "background tasks declare service identity and data scope".
- Keep the profile's full rules in the profile skill; register the pointer plus project-specific additions. Do not copy the entire profile into the workflow skills.
- When the user identifies the project as non-RuoYi, exclude the default profile, record the named alternative or `none`, and say why. Keep the explicit `none` registration even when there are no additional team conventions; it prevents later sessions from reapplying the global default.

Resolve the installed profile by name at runtime, not by a contributor's absolute path. Record the actual source/template locations and verification commands. Keep team-private additions in the target project. Omit the optional file only when there are no extra conventions and no selected profile or explicit `none` override to preserve.

Example registration for that confirmed stack (render in the project's documentation language and fill paths/commands from the checkout):

```text
Scope: Java business modules, plus-ui API/views, and SQL scripts
Stack and version: RuoYi-Vue-Plus 6.X — verify exact version in the parent POM
Technical profile: ruoyi-6-vue
Additional standards: project-relative team standard paths, or none
Source of API truth: current module source, neighboring implementations, and verified demo/framework paths
Verification: actual Maven and frontend commands, with working directories
```

On re-run, update only changed registrations. A requested tracker change does not authorize overwriting unrelated coding standards. The [Standards Gate](../rules/entry-protocol.md#standards-gate) defines loading, verification evidence and completion conditions for consumers. Register checks with their applicable stage/scope and actual commands; planning is not required to compile code that has not changed.

### Section H — WeChat Entry (Optional, Default Off)

> The WeChat assistant is one optional entry point, not a dependency of this skill set. It reads a **machine-level** project index (`~/.dsh/im/PROJECTS.md` on Windows) to know which project a message refers to, because one assistant serves many projects. A project that does not use it must still run standalone.

Ask once, defaulting to **off**: "Should this project be reachable from the WeChat assistant entry?"

**If no** (the default): drop the `## 微信需求与交接` and `## 微信调研简报` sections from `docs/agents/ai-collaboration.md`. Do not reference WeChat anywhere else. The project runs standalone.

**If yes**: keep those sections in `docs/agents/ai-collaboration.md` and fill in the project's real facts (repo root, remote, tracker, inbox paths, publish script paths). Then **print a registry entry** for the user to paste into `~/.dsh/im/PROJECTS.md`:

```text
## <项目显示名>
- 名称：<用于识别的别名，逗号分隔；避免与其他项目重名>
- 本机根目录：`<绝对路径>`。
- origin：`<远端 URL>`；分支每次用 Git 核对。
- 规则：`<项目根>/docs/agents/ai-collaboration.md`；微信仅按 REPORTER 通过受控脚本发布本条需求目录，不获得业务写权限。
- 状态入口：该项目 `docs/agents/project-state.md`；按需读 project-decisions.md、verification.md。
- 微信需求通过 `publish-wechat-requirement.ps1` 发布到 `<项目根>/docs/inbox/<需求ID>/`；只提交该目录。
- 微信调研通过 `publish-wechat-research.ps1` 发布到 `<项目根>/docs/research/inbox/<RES-ID>/`；简报是待核验材料。
```

**Boundary:** `PROJECTS.md` is global and belongs to the user, not to this project. This skill **outputs the entry text and stops** — it never writes that file, and never edits another project's entry. On re-run, if the project's facts changed (root moved, remote switched, tracker changed), re-print the updated entry for the user to replace.

**Why the separation matters:** the per-project facts live in `docs/agents/ai-collaboration.md`, which travels with the repo, enters Git, and comes back on a new machine. The index lives on one machine and merely points at those facts. Writing the global index from a per-repo skill would let one project's setup silently change another's registration.

## Step 5: Confirm

Show the user a draft of all files to be written. Let them edit before writing. The draft includes the `docs/agents/coding-standards.md` project-principles and verification sections; confirm their scope, placeholder fills, and quick-reference commands. Include an AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md pointer only when applicable.

## Step 6: Write

**Project files first.** Write `docs/agents/*.md` from the seed templates in [templates/](templates/). Do not create `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` when neither exists; the global Magpie instructions already provide the workflow.

**If a project file already exists, or the user explicitly asks for one:** update only that file, in place. Add a short `## Project context` section that points to `docs/agents/` and names the selected technical profile. Do not copy the global Working principles, engineering workflow, compile policy, page-acceptance policy, or Git rules. Do not create the other file when one already exists.

Example pointer (adapt to the project):

```markdown
## Project context

This repository uses the shared Magpie engineering baseline. Read `docs/agents/project-state.md`, `docs/agents/coding-standards.md`, and `docs/agents/domain.md` before affected work. Project-specific decisions and verification evidence live in `docs/agents/`.
```

Then write the remaining `docs/agents/` files. The project-specific engineering principles and verification quick reference go into `docs/agents/coding-standards.md`, from [templates/engineering-principles.md](templates/engineering-principles.md). Apply the Section E tailoring: drop inapplicable conditional blocks, fill placeholders from detected evidence, render in the Section D language. If the section already exists, update it in-place — never append a duplicate. If the user chose "adopt as-is" in Section E, skip writing it.

### Monorepo: Per-Package Config

For each detected package with its own domain scope, create `docs/agents/` inside that package as well, but with a simpler config:

```markdown
# Domain Docs (package: <pkg-name>)

This package's domain docs:
- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the package root (falls back to repo root if missing)
- **`docs/adr/`** at the package root (falls back to repo root if missing)

For shared conventions (including documentation language), see repo root `docs/agents/`.
```

**On re-run:** check that per-package `docs/agents/` dirs are still in sync with the current package structure. If packages were added, create new per-package configs. If packages were removed/renamed, update or remove the corresponding per-package configs (**ask first** before removing — destructive).

## Step 7: Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` directly later. Re-run this skill whenever the project structure changes, issue tracker switches, domain docs are reorganized, or documentation language preference changes. Re-running is always safe — it detects what changed and only touches affected files.

---

## Seed Templates

Each generated file is seeded from a template, customised based on the user's choices in Step 3-4. The templates live as separate files so they can be maintained independently and read on demand:

| Output file | Seed template | When used |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/agents/coding-standards.md` Project engineering principles + Verification quick reference | [templates/engineering-principles.md](templates/engineering-principles.md) | Always (tailor per Section E; skip if the user keeps their own section) |
| `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` (optional) | none | Only when the file already exists or the user explicitly asks; write a short `## Project context` pointer, not global rules |
| `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` | [templates/issue-tracker-github.md](templates/issue-tracker-github.md) | Remote points to github.com |
| | [templates/issue-tracker-gitlab.md](templates/issue-tracker-gitlab.md) | Remote points to gitlab.com or self-hosted GitLab |
| | [templates/issue-tracker-gitee.md](templates/issue-tracker-gitee.md) | Gitee selected; verify public vs Enterprise/private API |
| | [templates/issue-tracker-local.md](templates/issue-tracker-local.md) | No remote (local markdown in `.scratch/`) |
| `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` | [templates/triage-labels.md](templates/triage-labels.md) | Always (edit right-hand column to match the tracker's vocabulary) |
| `docs/agents/domain.md` | [templates/domain.md](templates/domain.md) | Always. **Before writing:** scan `docs/prd/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/research/` for existing files; replace the example filenames in the template's File structure section with the actual filenames, and omit empty/missing branches. On first run (no docs yet), use the template examples as-is. |
| `docs/agents/language.md` | [templates/language.md](templates/language.md) | Always (fill in the team's chosen language) |
| `docs/agents/coding-standards.md` | [templates/coding-standards.md](templates/coding-standards.md) | Project conventions or a technical profile are configured |
| `docs/agents/repo-map.md` | [templates/repo-map.md](templates/repo-map.md) | Multi-repo only |
| `docs/agents/ai-collaboration.md` | [templates/ai-collaboration.md](templates/ai-collaboration.md) | Multiple agents share a project; keep the WeChat sections only when Section H is enabled |
| `docs/agents/project-state.md` | [templates/project-state.md](templates/project-state.md) | Always (current objective, workflow-stage dashboard, active work, blockers, next step, actual compile commands) |
| `docs/agents/project-decisions.md` | [templates/project-decisions.md](templates/project-decisions.md) | Always (confirmed cross-task decisions; no placeholders — write only confirmed facts, or leave the section empty) |
| `docs/agents/verification.md` | [templates/verification.md](templates/verification.md) | Always (versioned evidence; write only facts actually observed, marked `agent` or `user`) |

Read the relevant template file, apply the user's Step 4 overrides, and write the customised result to the target path.
